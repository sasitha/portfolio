Started my professional career as a backend-focused Java developer in a dynamic project delivery environment.
Gained foundational experience in enterprise software development, working on custom solutions for diverse client needs.

Developed strong technical fundamentals in Java ecosystem technologies while learning to work effectively in team
environments.

Built the core development skills and professional practices that would support my progression through increasingly
senior technical roles.

Focused primarily on hands-on development while beginning to understand the broader context of client-focused software
delivery.
