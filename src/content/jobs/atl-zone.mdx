Promoted to associate technical leadership role within a 100+ person project delivery company.
Collaborated with senior architects and 10+ technical leads to make project-level technical decisions.

Began transitioning from pure development to team management, mentoring junior developers and coordinating task
assignments. Worked closely with the architecture team to understand enterprise-level technical decision making and
solution design.

This role prepared me for the technical lead position at Tunclab Solutions by providing exposure to larger-scale project
management and cross-team collaboration.
