Hi, I'm Sasitha Madushanka, a passionate software engineer specializing in full-stack development and cloud architecture. I reside in Wellington, New Zealand, where I enjoy the vibrant tech scene and beautiful landscapes.

For over 9 years, I've been on an exciting journey in software development, evolving from a junior developer to a senior technical leader. I focus on architecting scalable applications using modern technologies like React, AWS, and serverless architectures.

Throughout my career, I've worked with international clients, led cross-functional teams, and delivered enterprise solutions serving thousands of users. I'm particularly passionate about cloud-native development and helping businesses undergo digital transformation.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring New Zealand's stunning outdoors, experimenting with new technologies, and writing about my experiences with AWS and modern development practices. I also love mentoring junior developers and sharing knowledge through technical blog posts.

I'm an avid reader of technology books and cloud architecture patterns. When I'm not coding, you'll find me hiking Wellington's trails or working on side projects that solve real-world problems.

I'm always excited to connect with fellow developers and collaborate on interesting projects. Let's build something amazing together!
