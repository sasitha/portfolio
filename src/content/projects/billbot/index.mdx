# Multi-Tenant Utility Billing Platform (BillBot)

**Transforming Manual Billing Operations into Automated, Scalable SaaS Solutions**

---

## Project Overview

Led the development of a comprehensive multi-tenant SaaS platform designed to revolutionize utility billing operations for small to medium-sized electricity retailers. The solution automated complex billing processes that were previously managed through manual spreadsheets, eliminating errors and reducing administrative overhead by 80%+.

**Timeline:** 8 months | **Team Size:** 8 members | **Role:** Technical Lead & Full-Stack Developer

---

## The Market Challenge

Small and medium electricity retailers faced significant operational challenges that hindered their ability to compete effectively:

- **Manual Billing Operations:** Retailers relied on Excel spreadsheets and manual processes for customer billing
- **Error-Prone Workflows:** Human errors in billing calculations leading to revenue loss and customer disputes
- **Administrative Overhead:** 60-70% of operational time spent on billing administration rather than business growth
- **Scalability Barriers:** Manual processes couldn't scale with customer base growth
- **Compliance Complexity:** Difficulty maintaining audit trails and regulatory compliance
- **Integration Challenges:** No systematic way to integrate with smart meter providers and external systems

---

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

### High-Volume Data Processing
**Challenge:** Lambda concurrency limits and throttling during peak billing periods processing thousands of customers simultaneously.

**Solution:** Implemented sophisticated asynchronous architecture:
- **Event-driven processing** with SQS queues for workload distribution
- **Batch processing strategies** to optimize Lambda execution
- **Circuit breaker patterns** for handling external system failures
- **Dead letter queues** for error handling and retry mechanisms

### Complex Billing Logic
**Challenge:** Supporting diverse billing plans, cycles, and customer preferences across multiple retailers.

**Solution:** Built flexible configuration engine:
- **Rule-based billing engine** supporting unlimited plan configurations
- **Dynamic rate calculations** including time-of-use and tiered pricing
- **Customer-specific billing cycles** with automated scheduling
- **Configurable business rules** per tenant without code changes

### Smart Meter Integration
**Challenge:** Integrating with multiple smart meter providers with varying data formats and delivery mechanisms.

**Solution:** Standardized data ingestion pipeline:
- **Adapter pattern** for multiple meter provider APIs
- **Data validation and transformation** pipelines
- **Real-time monitoring** of data quality and completeness
- **Automated reconciliation** between meter readings and billing data
