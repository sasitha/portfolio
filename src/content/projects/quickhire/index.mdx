## Project Overview

Led the complete digital transformation of a New Zealand trailer rental company, converting their manual paper-based operations into a modern, scalable digital platform. The solution manages over 1,000 trailers across 20+ petrol station locations, processing hundreds of daily bookings while eliminating revenue leakage and operational inefficiencies.

**Timeline:** 6 months | **Team Size:** 8 members | **Role:** Technical Lead & Full-Stack Developer

## The Business Challenge

The client's traditional paper-based system was causing significant operational and financial pain:

- **Revenue Loss:** Manual paperwork errors leading to lost bookings and untracked rentals
- **Equipment Downtime:** Poor maintenance scheduling causing trailer unavailability
- **Asset Visibility:** No tracking system for overdue returns or overnight holdings across remote locations
- **Operational Blindness:** Zero real-time visibility into performance across 20+ sites
- **Infrastructure Costs:** Initial proposals required expensive custom kiosks at each location

---

## The Solution Architecture

### Multi-Platform Digital Ecosystem

I designed and led development of three integrated applications serving different user needs:

#### Smart KIOSK Application (React Native)
**Innovation:** Transformed standard Android tablets into cost-effective self-service kiosks

- Self-service booking management reducing customer wait times
- Cross-platform deployment flexibility across diverse petrol station environments
- Offline-first architecture ensuring operation during connectivity issues
- Microsoft Intune integration for remote device monitoring and management

#### Operations Management Portal (React)
**Full operational command and control dashboard**

- Real-time fleet management across 1,000+ trailers and 20+ locations
- Automated maintenance scheduling with proactive service notifications
- Overdue tracking system with automated customer communications
- Comprehensive analytics and reporting for business intelligence
- Role-based access control for different operational levels

#### Partner Portal (React)
**Streamlined interface for petrol station partners**

- Location-specific trailer inventory management
- Real-time data synchronization ensuring accuracy across the network
- Simplified workflows for non-technical staff
